- Queue: 队列

![Queue](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Data_Queue.svg/600px-Data_Queue.svg.png)
> In computer science, a queue (/ˈkjuː/ KYEW) is a particular kind of abstract data type or collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the principle (or only) operations on the collection are _the addition of entities to the rear terminal position_, known as **enqueue**, and _removal of entities from the front terminal position_, known as **dequeue**. 

> 又称为伫列（queue），是先进先出（FIFO, First-In-First-Out）的线性表。在具体应用中通常用链表或者数组来实现。队列只允许在后端（称为rear）进行插入操作，在前端（称为front）进行删除操作。

- FIFO 

![FIFO](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Fifo_queue.png)
> is an acronym for first in, first out, a method for organizing and manipulating a data buffer, where the oldest (first) entry, or 'head' of the queue, is processed first.It is analogous to processing a queue with first-come, first-served (**FCFS**) behaviour: where the people leave the queue in the order in which they arrive.
> “先进先出法”是一种排程算法。它描述了一个伫列所使用的先到先得服务方式：先进入伫列的工作将先被完成，之后进来的则必须稍候。
- Abstract Data Type(ADT): 抽象数据类型
> In computer science, an abstract data type (ADT) is a mathematical model for data types, where a data type is defined by its behavior (semantics) from the point of view of a user of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations.
